Pyber

Used python, pandas and matplotlib to build bubble plots and pie charts to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation for ride sharing companies given a company's compelete recordset of rides. 

The analysis focused on relationships between: 

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

Findings: 
1.) Irrespective of the 'type of city', average fare ($) tends to decrease as the number of total rides (per city) increases, suggesting an inverse relationship.

2.) In three areas: % of drivers by city type, % of total rides by city type, and % of total fares by city type, urban cities are the largest population followed by suburban cities, followed by rural cities. 

3.) As the total number of rides (per city) increases, the driver count per day increases.
